# StudentRecordSystemInC

This is a project-in-progress, but aims to create a simple console-based app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete student records.

This ReadMe will be updated as the project progresses.


Ultimately, this is just motivated by me wanting to remember how C works (it's a fun language), so please feel free to throw extra challenges and recommendations for this rather simple idea my way.
